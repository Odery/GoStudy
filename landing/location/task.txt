Use the code from listings 22.1, 22.2, and 22.3 to write a program that declares a location
for each location in table 22.1. Print out each of the locations in decimal degrees.


Use the distance method from listing 22.4 to write a program that determines the distance
between each pair of landing sites in table 22.1.
Which two landing sites are the closest?
Which two are farthest apart?
To determine the distance between the following locations, you’ll need to declare other 
worlds based on table 22.2:
 Find the distance from London, England (51°30’N 0°08’W) to Paris, France 
(48°51’N 2°21’E).
 Find the distance from your city to the capital of your country.
 Find the distance between Mount Sharp (5°4' 48"S, 137°51’E) and Olympus Mons 
(18°39’N, 226°12’E) on Mars.
