Write a program that displays temperature conversion 
tables. The tables should use equals signs (=) and pipes 
(|) to draw lines, with a header section:
=======================
| ºC | ºF |
=======================
| -40.0 | -40.0 |
| ... | ... |
=======================
The program should draw two tables. The first table has 
two columns, with ºC in the first column and ºF in the 
second column. Loop from –40º C through 100º C in 
steps of 5º using the temperature conversion methods 
from lesson 13 to fill in both columns.
After completing one table, implement a second table with the columns reversed, converting from ºF to ºC.
Drawing lines and padding values is code you can reuse for any data that needs to be 
displayed in a two-column table. Use functions to separate the table drawing code from 
the code that calculates the temperatures for each row.

Implement a drawTable function that takes a first-class function as a parameter and calls it 
to get data for each row drawn. Passing a different function to drawTable should result in 
different data being displayed.
