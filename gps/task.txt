    Write a program with a gps structure for a Global Positioning System (GPS). This struct
should be composed of a current location, destination location, and a world.
Implement a description method for the location type that returns a string containing the 
name, latitude, and longitude. The world type should implement a distance method 
using the math from lesson 22.
    Attach two methods to the gps type. First, attach a distance method that finds the distance 
between the current and destination locations. Then implement a message method that 
returns a string describing how many kilometers remain to the destination.
As a final step, create a rover structure that embeds the gps and write a main function to 
test everything out. Initialize a GPS for Mars with a current location of Bradbury Landing
(-4.5895, 137.4417) and a destination of Elysium Planitia (4.5, 135.9). Then create a 
curiosity rover and print out its message (which forwards to the gps).
