 Extend listing 16.8 to display all the chess pieces at their starting positions using 
the characters kqrbnp for black pieces along the top and uppercase KQRBNP for white 
pieces on the bottom.

 Instead of strings, use [8][8]rune to represent the board. Recall that rune literals are 
surrounded with single quotes and can be printed with the %c format verb.
