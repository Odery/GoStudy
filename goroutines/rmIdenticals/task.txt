It’s boring to see the same line repeated over and over again. Write a pipeline element (a 
goroutine) that remembers the previous value and only sends the value to the next stage 
of the pipeline if it’s different from the one that came before. To make things a little
simpler, you may assume that the first value is never the empty string.
