planets := [...]string{ 
		"Mercury",
		"Venus",

	   }
Write a program to terraform a slice of strings by prepending each planet with "New ". 
Use your program to terraform Mars, Uranus, and Neptune.
Your first iteration can use a terraform function, but your final implementation should 
introduce a Planets type with a terraform method, similar to sort.StringSlice.
