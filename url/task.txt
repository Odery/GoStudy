In the Go standard library, thereâ€™s a function to parse web addresses (see golang.org/ 
pkg/net/url/#Parse). Display the error that occurs when url.Parse is used with an invalid 
web address, such as one containing a space: https://a b.com/.
Use the %#v format verb with Printf to learn more about the error. Then perform a 
*url.Error type assertion to access and print the fields of the underlying structure.

NOTE: A URL, or Uniform Resource Locator, is the address of a page on the World Wide
Web.
